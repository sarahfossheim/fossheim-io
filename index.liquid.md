<h2>
    I'm a multidisciplinary developer and designer, with a strong interest in data science, AI, ethics and accessibility.
</h2>

<p>
    I have over 6 years of experience within full-stack development (specialized in front-end), 
    user experience design and research. I also have knowledge in product management, 
    data science and machine learning.
</p>

<p>
    The past years I have focused on the user experience and development of data-heavy 
    products within the public sector, cancer medicine and education. Specializing in
    visualizing and using data in an accessible, safe and user-friendly way.
</p>

<p>
    My favorite projects are those where I get to combine my knowledge of technology and
    design to build and manage smart solutions for complex problems - 
    while always keeping a strong focus on user experience, ethics, accessibility, diversity and inclusion.
